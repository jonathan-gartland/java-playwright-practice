### Description:
This is a simple project to practice Playwright with Java, using TestNG and Maven as the test runner.  
The project contains two test cases, NewTestCase and MpnLookupTestCase.

### How to run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run the test using the TestNG configuration
4. Check the test results in the console

### Test:
NewTestCase goes to openstreetmap.org, closes the pop up, and then 
clicks the link to User Diary's before confirming that is the page that opens.  
  
MpnLookupTestCase is a rewrite of the Playright UI tests I wrote using Javascript for the practice-pages React demo. It
Checks the links on the page, and some of the basic functionality of the page.
